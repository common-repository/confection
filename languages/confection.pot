" Add that to any page or post on which you want Confection to run.<br /><br />Note, some themes don't include the native WordPress footer function. If, after selecting the above checkbox and saving this page, Confection isn't active on your site's front end, this is probably the issue.<br /><br /> \r\n"
"                Like many plugins, Confection's script files and functions are bound to the  <code>wp_footer</code> hook. If your theme doesn't include the WP footer function, and you want Confection to run sitewide, you'll need to add the above shortcode to some universal element. For example, you could add it to a text widget (Appearance > Widgets) and drag it into your sidebar, header, or footer widget area.<br /><br />Confused? Still having issues?
