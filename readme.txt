<strong>About</strong>

Confection is a new kind of product. It's a data generator for the privacy-first world.

It uses an innovative architecture to collect, store, and distribute data, one that's unaffected by client-side disruptions. There's no need to worry about cookies, cross-domain scripts, or device IDs. Confection is also compliant with globalprivacy laws like GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD so it's good for people too.
And it integrates with the apps businesses and developers already use. There's no need to switch systems. Just plug in, power up, and keep your marketing partnerships running strong.
